Hello all,
This is the top level README for the solution.

The solution can be broken down as:
1. Get the input list of tuples
2. Find the pairs of overlapping circles from the input
3. Find 'n' separate clusters among the list of tuples of circles.
4. Find the circle with highest area from each cluster and remove the rest of the circles.

I have included 2 files named solution.py and test.py.
solution.py:-
This is the main solution file with a commented block at the end which accepts custom inputs.
Please uncomment the block for custom inputs

test.py:-
The test.py is necessary for the testing the entire solution.
Following test cases have been reported:
TEST CASE 1 - Provided in the assignment
TEST CASE 2 - Provided in the assignment
TEST CASE 3 - Provided in the assignment
TEST CASE 4 - This test case includes two different clusters
TEST CASE 5 - This test case includes two different clusters along with 2 non-overlapping circles

Running the code:
python test.py
python solution.py
